# Introduction to psychology

## What is psychology?

- From greek: psyche – soul; logos – science (literally “word”)
- Psychology – a scientific discipline that studies psychological and biological processes and behaviour in humans and other animal (Encyclopaedia Brittanicca)
- Psychology is the study of behaviour and mind, embracing all aspects of conscious and unconscious experience as well as thought (Wikipedia)

## What is NOT psychology?

- Philosophy (love of wisdom, study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, language)
- Sociology (study of social behavior or society, including its origins, development, organization, networks and institutions)

## What is NOT psychology?

- Physiology (study of the normal function in living systems, a sub-discipline of biology, focuses on how organisms, organ systems, organs, cells and biomolecules carry out the chemical or physical functions that exist in a living system)
- Pseudo-scientific, non-scientific or layman psychology


## Scientific vs. non-scientific psychology

--------------------------------------------------------------------
**SCIENTIFIC**                  **NON-SCIENTIFIC**               
------------------------------  ------------------------------------
Verified by empirical research  Theories based on common knowledge

Results published in            Publications in popular magazines, internet
peer-reviewed journals 

Replicable research             No research is conducted
--------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methods in psychology
- Observational studies
- Case studies
- Introspection
- Interviews
- Questionnaire studies
- **Experiments**

## A brief history of psychology

- Until the end of 19th century psychology was in fact part of philosophy
- Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Hume, Locke, Descartes, Kant… 
- 1879 – first psychological laboratory, Wilhelm Wundt, University Leipzig, Germany 
- Since then psychology as a separate scientific discipline

# Psychophysics

## Psychophysics
> Physiology provides sensations, observer provides perceptions 

*H. Helmholtz, 1821-1894*

## Psychophysics
![Railway tracks](img/01railTracks.jpg)

- The tracks are converging – sensation
 
- The tracks are parallel – perception

## Psychophysics
- Imagine two weights: 100 g and 130 g.
- Would you be able to tell the difference between the two?

- Now imagine another two weights: 10 kg and 10.03 kg (10,030 g).
- Would you be able to tell the difference between those two?

- How heavy the other weight needs to be for you to feel the difference?

## Psychophysics
- Weber–Fechner Law:
    - I – stimulus intensity
    - ∆I – just-noticeable difference in intensity
    - K – constant

- ∆I/I = K

- ∆I = I * K

- This (sort of) works for weight, sound, light etc.


# Gestalt psychology

## Gestalt psychology
- A movement in German psychology, late 19th century
- It is not possible to describe the human mind by analyzing its structure, one needs to look at the global whole
- *“The whole is something other than the sum of its parts”* (Kurt Koffka)

## Gestalt – emergence
![Dog](img/01emergence.gif)

## Gestalt – emergence
- We see a dog (a Dalmatian?)
- We do not recognize its parts independently (nose, ears, head, paws)
- We see the dog in its entirety, at once
- “The whole is something other than the sum of its parts”

## Gestalt – reification
![Reification](img/01reification.jpg)

## Gestalt – reification
- Our perception can generate more information on the object than it is given in reality
- In picture A we see a triangle, though there is no triangle drawn
- In pictures B and D, the eye recognizes disparate shapes as "belonging" to a single shape 
- In C a complete three-dimensional shape is seen, where actually no such thing is drawn

## Gestalt - multistability
![Multistability](img/01multistability.png)

## Gestalt - multistability
![Multistability 2](img/01multistability2.jpg)


## Gestalt - multistability
- Multistability is a tendency of ambiguous perceptual experiences to pop back and forth unstably between two or more alternative interpretations
- Gestalt psychologists described the effect but did not give an explanation
- The Necker Cube is used today to test computer-based models of perception

## Gestalt - invariance
![Invariance](img/01invariance.jpg)


## Gestalt - invariance
- Invariance is the property of perception whereby simple geometrical objects are recognized independent of rotation, translation, and scale; as well as several other variations such as elastic deformations, different lighting, and different component features
- These laws of perception were since explored by cognitive psychologists, and some are puzzling to this day

## Perception today
- Perception is generative
- Same stimulus may be interpreted in different ways depending on:
    - Context
    - Who is looking
    - Memory is used in perception



# Psychoanalysis

## Psychoanalysis
![Freud](img/01freud.png)

## Psychoanalysis
- Created by Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), a neurologist working in Vienna
- Modified versions of psychoanalysis are still widely used in psychotherapy
- Its scientific status is often disputed

## Psychoanalysis – basic assumptions
1. A person's development is determined by often forgotten events in early childhood rather than by inherited traits alone
2. Human attitude, mannerism, experience, and thought is largely influenced by irrational drives that are rooted in the unconscious
3. It is necessary to bypass psychological resistance in the form of defense mechanisms when bringing drives into awareness

## Psychoanalysis – basic assumptions
4. Conflicts between the conscious and the unconscious, or with repressed material can materialize in the form of mental or emotional disturbances, for example: neurosis, neurotic traits, anxiety, depression etc.
5. Liberating the elements of the unconscious is achieved through bringing this material into the conscious mind (via e.g. skilled guidance, i.e. therapeutic intervention).

## Personality in psychoanalysis
![Personality](img/01personalityFreud.png)

## Psychoanalytic therapy - tools
- Free associations method
- Analysis of dreams
- Analysis of defense mechanisms
- Re-living things that happened in the past
- Hypnosis
