# Introduction to psychology

## What is psychology?

- From greek: psyche – soul; logos – science (literally “word”)
- Psychology – a scientific discipline that studies psychological and biological processes and behaviour in humans and other animal (Encyclopaedia Brittanicca)
- Psychology is the study of behaviour and mind, embracing all aspects of conscious and unconscious experience as well as thought (Wikipedia)

- Pseudo-scientific, non-scientific or layman psychology


## Scientific vs. non-scientific psychology

**SCIENTIFIC**                  **NON-SCIENTIFIC**               
------------------------------  ------------------------------------
Verified by empirical research  Theories based on common knowledge

Results published in            Publications in popular magazines, internet
peer-reviewed journals

- **Experiments**

## A brief history of psychology

- Until the end of 19th century psychology was in fact part of philosophy
- Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Hume, Locke, Descartes, Kant… 

## A brief history

- 1879 – first psychological laboratory, Wilhelm Wundt, University Leipzig, Germany 
- Since then psychology as a separate scientific discipline

## Movements in 20th-century psychology

- Psychoanalysis
- Behaviorism

# Psychoanalysis

## Psychoanalysis

## Psychoanalysis

- Created by Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), a neurologist working in Vienna
- Modified versions of psychoanalysis are still widely used in psychotherapy
- Its scientific status is often disputed

## Psychoanalysis – basic assumptions

1. A person's development is determined by often forgotten events in early childhood rather than by inherited traits alone
2. Human attitude, mannerism, experience, and thought is largely influenced by irrational drives that are rooted in the unconscious
3. It is necessary to bypass psychological resistance in the form of defense mechanisms when bringing drives into awareness

## Psychoanalysis – basic assumptions

4. Conflicts between the conscious and the unconscious, or with repressed material can materialize in the form of mental or emotional disturbances, for example: neurosis, neurotic traits, anxiety, depression etc.
5. Liberating the elements of the unconscious is achieved through bringing this material into the conscious mind (via e.g. skilled guidance, i.e. therapeutic intervention).

## Personality in psychoanalysis

![Personality](img/01personalityFreud.png)

## Psychoanalytic therapy - tools

- Free associations method
- Analysis of dreams
- Analysis of defense mechanisms
- Re-living things that happened in the past
- Hypnosis

# Behaviorism

## Behaviorism

- Created by John Watson (early 20th century), expanded by B.F.Skinner (1930s-1950s)
- Psychology should only be concerned with the study of *objective, observable behaviour*
- Phenomena such as thoughts, feelings, values, etc. are *not measurable*, and should be of no concern to scientists

## Behaviorism

- This view is now somewhat obsolete, though learning theory is a part of modern cognitive psychology
- A key component of behaviorism is the *process of conditioning*


## Mechanisms of learning

- **Classical conditioning** (Ivan Pavlov)
- **Operant conditioning** (Thorndike, Skinner, Konorski)
- **Modelling / social learning theory** (Bandura)

## Classical conditioning

## Classical conditioning works on people

## Operant conditioning
![Operant conditioning](img/02operant.png)

## Reinforcement:

  - Increases the chance that behavior will occur again in future
  - Positive reinforcement occurs when a behavior (response) is rewarding or the behavior is followed by another stimulus that is rewarding, increasing the frequency of that behavior. 
  - Negative reinforcement occurs when the rate of a behavior increases because an aversive event or stimulus is removed or prevented from happening.

## Punishment:
- Decreases the chance of repeating the behavior in future
- Positive punishment - presenting aversive stimuli
- Negative punishment – removing the reinforcing stimulus

## Behavioral theory – applications

- Applied behavior analysis – a radical behaviorist method of treatment, useful in autism, behavioral disorders, substance abuse
- Various animal learning models (i.e. used in physiological research)

## Behavioral theory – applications

- Cognitive-behavioral therapy – most widely used evidence-based intervention for treating mental disorders (i.e. depression, mood disorders, PTSD, eating disorders, OCD) as well as some supplementary treatment for other conditions (i.e. chronic low back pain, fibromyalgia)

## Modern psychology

- Explores **behavior and mental processes** 
- These include: perception, thought, attention, emotion, intelligence, subjective experiences, motivation, personality and more
- Studies conscious **and** unconscious phenomena
- Analysis from **individual as well as social** perspectives

## Modern psychology

- Focuses on **cognition** (*cognitive science*)
- Uses neuroscience to inform the study of the mind
- Frequently explains psychological phenomena in terms of their **evolutionary fitness**
- Is also a practical discipline, focused on assessment and treatment of mental health problems, counselling, education etc.
