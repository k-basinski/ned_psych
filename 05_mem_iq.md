    - someone is good at English but bad at maths?
    - someone is bad at English and maths but is a world-class pianist?
    - Einstein was born in a hunter-gatherer tribe?

---

### Intelligence is multi-dimensional

- People are good at different cognitive skills
- These tend to correlate with each other
- Overall intelligence (as measured by IQ) takes **a lot of those skills** into account

---

### Intelligence Quotient - IQ

### Nature vs. nurture

- IQ depends on nature (genetic factors)
- IQ depends on nurture (education, experience, age)

---

### IQ correlates

- School performance (0.50 - 0.80)
- Job performance (0.20 - 0.60)
- Income (0.23)
- Crime (-0.20)
- Mortality/morbidity (-, very weak)

---

### IQ - Facts and myths

- Can you teach intelligence?
- Yes, you can! To some degree...
- In fact, educated societies tend to get smarter over time

---

### IQ - Facts and myths

- You are either born smart or stupid
- Yes and no
- There are significant genetic and environmental components of IQ

---

### IQ - Facts and myths

- White/black/yellow/red people smarter than white/black/yellow/red people
- No! 
- The question is in fact ill-posed
- IQ is defined through a mean of population. Thus, different cultures have by definition the same average IQ = 100.

### IQ - Facts and myths

- Are rich people are smarter than poor people?
- Hard to say
- Correlation is 0.20 (very, very weak)
- Richer people might be better educated
