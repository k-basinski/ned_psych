---

### Conformity

- Group influence
- Asch experiment - 57% incorrect vs. 1% without group influence

---

### Two types of conformity

- Informational conformity:
  - Actually change your beliefs
- Normative conformity:
  - You know that's not true but you go along nonetheless

---
### Controlling normative conformity

- If nobody hears your answer, you're immune from criticism
- Conformity drops by 2/3

---

### Group unanimity

- Unanimity = everybody agrees with themselves
- Size of group matters until circa 5 people
- Unanimity is more important than size
- Even one deviant significantly reduces conformity
